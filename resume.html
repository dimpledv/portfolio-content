                This past summer, I worked at an EMR developer company, eClinicalWorks to utilize my data analysis skills, to help the company improve performance of their products' user satisfaction.
                I have enhanced my skillset through this experience and would love to continue working in the space of health informatics.

                As a dentist in India, I had the chance to digitize the patient management system at my clinic. 
                I made the decision to pursue a Masters in Health Informatics at the University of Michigan to learn more about data-driven innovation in healthcare, and I am loving it so far.
