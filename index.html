                Hi, I am Dimple Vaswani. I am passionate about bringing change in healthcare delivery using my user expereience skills. 
                I am a second year student at the University of Michigan School of Information, focusing aspiring to be a healthcare data analyst and user experience researcher completing my Masters in Health Informatics.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy discovering problems through data and finding creative solutions to solve those problems. My specializations range from dealing with large healthcare data sets to devlop deep meaningful insights about the data.
                I love learning and exploring new things in my personal and professional demeanors. In the future, I want to work as a product manager to apply my skills in design, product thinking, analytics, strategy, and stakeholder management!
